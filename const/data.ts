The main goals were to launch a payload running hardware and software similar to that which would fly on our first satellite and to launch a payload as a team. The payload consisted of a Raspberry Pi, a mounting plate, a camera and two 2-axis gimbals lifted by a 4-foot diameter helium balloon. The flight was successful, and we got some great pics of campus which you can see here:",

Its design invites broad participation, allowing students and the public to engage with and contribute to the mission through algorithm development and testing, building on the success of the ESAâ€™s OPS-SAT. VECTOR combines optical astronomy with a modular in-house developed bus architecture, serving as an accessible in-space testbed and transient event observer.",
