Its design invites broad participation, allowing students and the public to engage with and contribute to the mission through algorithm development and testing, building on the success of the ESAâ€™s OPS-SAT. VECTOR combines optical astronomy with a modular in-house developed bus architecture, serving as an accessible in-space testbed and transient event observer.",
